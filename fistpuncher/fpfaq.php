<b>Fist Puncher FAQ</b>
<br><br><br>

Q: Wasn't there a Fist Puncher Kickstarter?
<br><br>
A: In April of 2012, we raised $23,723 on Kickstarter to fund development of Fist Puncher.
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>
Q: What's the story with the $10k backer on the Kickstarter campaign?   
<br><br>
A: Someone did pledge $10k to have us make a game for them, but that game is not Fist Puncher.  It's another beat 'em up called Escape From Hizbollia."  It's finished but we're holding it back for later this year.
<br><br><br><br>
Q: Are there real people in Fist Puncher?
<br><br>A: Some of the hidden playable characters and NPCs are based on real people who supported our Kickstarter campaign.  There is also signage from real small businesses, from a local kettle corn company to other videogames.  We try to work with like minded indies in all lines of business.
<br><br>
One of our backers is Dracogen, Inc., an investment company that has funded several Double Fine Projects.  You can even play as Dracogen and XE.com founder Steven Dengler.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Q: Weren't you on IGN's Next Game Boss as "Team Fist Puncher"?   
<br><br>
A: Yes.  Working with IGN has been a great experience.  Good people.

Q: Didn't you win that? Where can I get that game?
<br><br>
A: Yes, since you ask, we did win. Washington's Wig is available on Xbox Live Indie Games.

<br><br>
Q: What's this about you guys being brothers?  That's bullshit right?  Brothers can't work together.
<br><br>
A: Team2Bit is Jake and Matt Lewandowski.  We are brothers.  Sorry you hate your family.
<br><br><br><br>
Q: Is that Polish Vogue article real?
<br><br>
A: You decide. Read it for yourself here:

<br><br>
<br><br>

Q: Can I interview you?  Will you come on our podcast?
<br><br>
A: We love doing that kind of stuff.  We don't have time for everything, but we do as much as we can.  Email us at info@team2bit.com and let us know what you're looking for.
<br><br>
<br><br>

Q: Why is Fist Puncher local co-op only?  Isn't that for losers?
<br><br>
A: We're a small studio (just the 2 of us) so we had to make some difficult choices when it came to the game's features.  We didn't have the resources to do it right, so we didn't want to mess it up. 
<br><br>
Besides, we think local co-op is the superior co-op.  Make friends, go to other human being's homes, share food and conversation while you play videogames.  Or, if you already have friends or family, consider them as local co-op partners.  What's better than a little face-to-face human interaction now and then?
<br><br>
<br><br>

Q: What's with this typo-inspired Fist Puncher parody?
<br><br>
A: It's called Fish Puncher, check it out here:

Q: What games influenced Fist Puncher?
<br><br>
A: Double Dragon, River City Ransom, Manhunter (Sierra PC), Gauntlet, NES Pro Wrestling, Castle Crashers.
